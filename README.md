Hi y'all,

I am a Maasters Mechanical Enigneer, actively seeking full0time opportunities.
While I was searchingfor the best carers in future, I cam across Data-Scientist role.
That is the first time I have ever heard of Data Science, then i started learning about DS and fell in love with the subject.
Now, here I am studying DS, and I wuld like to launch my career in Data Science.
